Welcome to our autoscaling scenario, where you will have the chance to explore and experiment with several tools and technologies in a small Kubernetes environment. In this scenario, you will work with MetalLB, Envoy Gateway, and KEDA along with its HTTP add-on. These tools will help you understand how to manage network traffic and autoscale applications based on traffic.

To help you navigate through the different tasks, you can use [`tmux`{{}}](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) or Killercoda tabs to keep your workflow organized and efficient.
