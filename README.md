# KEDA Meets GatewayAPI

This repository contains slides and resources for a [killercoda demo](https://killercoda.com/wozniakjan-kcd/scenario/killercoda).

> With GatewayAPI becoming a popular choice to manage network traffic, we will see how KEDA's capability to interpret various metrics as scaling decisions can be used to automate deployment patterns. By bringing these two technologies together, I would like to advocate for a revised look into standard traffic management strategies.
